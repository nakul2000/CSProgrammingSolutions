PROBLEM DESCRIPTION
==============================================================================================
Write a program to calculate the roots of a list of quadratic equations.  Your program should
tell the user if a quadratic equation does not have real roots.

INPUT SPECIFICATION
==============================================================================================
The input file "input.txt" contains the coefficients (A, B, and C) for a number of quadratic
equations. The first line of the input file indicates the number of quadratic equations in 
the input file.

OUTPUT SPECIFICATION
==============================================================================================
The sample output file "output.txt" states the roots of each quadratic equation, if it has
real roots.  Your output file should match the smample output as closely as possible.
